    "Ans - Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "1] Applies to: Discrete random variables, which take on a countable set of distinct values (e.g., the number of heads in a coin toss, the roll of a die).\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Definition: The PMF of a discrete random variable X, denoted as P(X = x), gives the probability that X takes on the specific value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Example: Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF would assign a probability of 1/6 to each of the possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n",

    "\n",
    "1] Applies to: Continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a certain range (e.g., height, weight, temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Definition: The PDF of a continuous random variable X, denoted as f(x), describes the relative likelihood of X taking on a value within a small interval around x. It does not directly give the probability of X being exactly equal to x (which is technically zero for continuous variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Example: Consider the height of adult humans. The PDF might be a bell-shaped curve (normal distribution), where the height of an individual is more likely to be near the average height and less likely to be very short or very tall. The area under the curve between two height values represents the probability of a person's height falling within that range."

    "Ans - The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), often denoted as F(x), describes the probability that a random variable X takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value x. In simpler terms, it represents the accumulated probability up to a certain point in the distribution.   \n",
